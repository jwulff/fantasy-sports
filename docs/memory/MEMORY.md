| Memory | Hook |
|---|---|
| [prior-art-graveyard.md](prior-art-graveyard.md) | Why every previous ESPN fantasy tool died, with dates — the reason the health system exists |
| [typer-vendors-click.md](typer-vendors-click.md) | typer 0.27 bundles click privately and drops the dependency — `import click` fails at runtime, on an error path |
| [ruff-format-rewrites-markdown.md](ruff-format-rewrites-markdown.md) | `ruff format .` silently reformats Python inside `docs/*.md` — why `extend-exclude = ["docs"]` must stay |
| [import-budget-and-the-fastpath.md](import-budget-and-the-fastpath.md) | Importing typer costs 44 ms against a 50 ms budget — why the argparse front door exists and how the two help surfaces stay in sync |
| [runtime-checkable-proves-less-than-it-looks.md](runtime-checkable-proves-less-than-it-looks.md) | `isinstance(x, Provider)` checks method *names* only, and `issubclass` raises — why an adapter's conformance test must call every method |
| [credential-leak-channels.md](credential-leak-channels.md) | The three automatic channels a credential leaks through — captured-locals reprs, caller-formatted messages, cassettes — and why fail-soft belongs to the chain, not the reader |
| [cassette-scrubbing-blind-spots.md](cassette-scrubbing-blind-spots.md) | A gzipped or `!!binary` cassette body defeats the SWID scrubber and a grep-based scan — why `decode_compressed_response` and the structural scan pass exist |
| [config-toml-is-a-shared-namespace.md](config-toml-is-a-shared-namespace.md) | Every layer reads `config.toml`, so unknown top-level keys must be tolerated — plus the XDG test-isolation and `bool`-is-an-`int` traps |
| [parallel-wave-seams.md](parallel-wave-seams.md) | What a four-way parallel wave actually costs, and the two seams that are dangerous to close late — a scrub that must move with the class that did it, and a duplicated type that must be merged rather than wrapped |
| [cache-redaction-and-tag-classes.md](cache-redaction-and-tag-classes.md) | Why `core/redaction.py` holds two scrubbers, why the cache decodes before it scrubs with no vcrpy to do it, and why `players_wl` needs a season-scoped tag class of its own |
| [output-contract-test-traps.md](output-contract-test-traps.md) | Two ways an output-contract test passes while measuring nothing — a pty drained after the child exits, and a golden file rendered by a transitive `rich` |
| [swid-pseudonyms.md](swid-pseudonyms.md) | Flattening a join key is not redaction, it is data loss — why a SWID becomes a per-GUID pseudonym, why the sentinel first group is load-bearing, and the confirmable-mapping trade the cassette salt buys |
| [espn-401-tells-you-nothing.md](espn-401-tells-you-nothing.md) | ESPN's 401 body carries a typed reason and it is a constant — why the double-probe stays mandatory, why `AUTH_LEAGUE_NOT_VISIBLE` never means `AUTH_EXPIRED`, and why the `fan.api` membership probe is not wired in |
| [espn-api-is-a-shape-reader-not-a-client.md](espn-api-is-a-shape-reader-not-a-client.md) | What `espn-api` gives you (payload shapes) and what it never will (429, `Retry-After`, drift detection, a non-`Exception` empty result) — and where the transport seam has to sit |
| [no-code-for-a-bad-argument.md](no-code-for-a-bad-argument.md) | The taxonomy describes the world, not the invocation — where a bad `--pos` or `--filter` lands, why exit 2 is the CLI's own, and why `--no-cache` must be a cache mode |
| [generated-callbacks-and-a-test-tree-that-bites.md](generated-callbacks-and-a-test-tree-that-bites.md) | Typer callbacks assembled from declared params rather than handler signatures — plus duplicate test/`conftest` basenames, and the `--disable-socket` that stopped the live suite ever running |
Nothing here should duplicate what the code, git history, `CLAUDE.md`, or
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` already record.
