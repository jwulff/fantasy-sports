# fantasy-sports — Architecture Design

**Status:** Draft for review (pre-repo)
**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Author:** John Wulff (with Claude)

An agent-native CLI for fantasy sports leagues. ESPN first, provider-agnostic by
construction. Read-only in v0.1.

---

## 0. Why this exists

Verified 2026-08-26: there is no maintained CLI for ESPN fantasy leagues.

| Project | Stars | Last push | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cwendt94/espn-api` | 948 | 2026-08-18 | Healthy — a **library**, not a CLI |
| `derekrbreese/fantasy-football-mcp-public` | 61 | 2026-08-26 | Healthy — **Yahoo only**, MCP not CLI |
| `KBThree13/mcp_espn_ff` | 41 | 2025-12-19 | **8 months stale** — most-starred ESPN MCP |
| `gtonic/nfl_mcp` | 15 | 2026-08-24 | NFL news, not league management |
| `jdguggs10/flaim` | 13 | 2026-08-26 | Multi-platform, hosted, **read-only** |
| `Avanderheyde/espn-fantasy-cli` | 0 | 2026-07-30 | **One commit**, abandoned, unpublished |

PyPI namespace is entirely open. Every prior attempt died the same death: ESPN
changed something, nobody noticed, the repo went quiet. **Decision 11 (the canary)
is the direct response to that failure mode.**

---

## 1. Naming

| Surface | Value |
|---|---|
| GitHub | `jwulff/fantasy-sports` |
| PyPI | `fantasy-sports` |
| Command (canonical) | `fantasy-sports` |
| Command (alias) | `fantasy` |

Both entry points declared in `pyproject.toml`; both verified free on PATH.
Descriptive over clever — the name should tell you what it is without insider
vocabulary.

---

## 2. Language: Python

**Decision: Python 3.12+.**

The entire fantasy-sports API ecosystem exists in exactly one language:

| Provider | Library | Version | Last release |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESPN | `espn-api` | 0.46.0 | 2026-03-23 |
| Yahoo | `yfpy` | 17.0.0 | 2025-09-14 |
| Sleeper | `sleeper-api-wrapper` | 1.2.1 | 2025-11-02 |

Go's single static binary is genuinely better for cron, and it loses anyway:
choosing Go means reimplementing `espn-api`, which is not a thin HTTP client but
948 stars of accumulated knowledge about an undocumented API — view parameters,
scoring-setting shapes, position eligibility maps, the 2024 base-URL migration.
That rewrite *is* the project, and you would then do it twice more.

Distribution gap is closed by `uv tool install fantasy-sports`.

**Floor is 3.12** (`tomllib` in stdlib since 3.11; 3.12 for typing ergonomics).

### Toolchain

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Packaging | `uv` + `hatchling` | Already installed (0.11.3); fast, lockfile-native |
| CLI framework | `typer` | Type annotations do double duty as MCP schemas later |
| Rendering | `rich` | Tables for TTY, and typer already depends on it |
| Config read | TOML via `tomllib` | Stdlib, no dependency |
| Config **write** | `tomli-w` | `tomllib` is read-only; `auth login` and config edits need a writer |
| HTTP | `requests` | Matches `espn-api`'s own transport. Mixing two stacks under VCR is a known source of pain, and a synchronous CLI has no async need |
| Dev deps | PEP 735 `[dependency-groups]` | Current standard; `[project.optional-dependencies]` is the legacy shape for this purpose |
| Tests | `pytest` + `vcrpy` | `espn-api` is built on `requests`, which is vcrpy's best-supported target |
| Type check | `pyright` | Recommended for CI today; `ty` is worth watching but not yet the default |
| Secrets | `keyring` | Standard, with a documented locked-Keychain-under-cron footgun that env-first resolution already mitigates |

Validated against 2026 practice in `docs/research/04-python-cli-packaging.md`,
which confirmed every prior choice and resolved the open ones above.

**Note:** there is no `uv build --standalone`. `uv build` produces an sdist and
a wheel only. Standalone binaries would require PyInstaller or Nuitka, assessed
and deferred — see the research brief.

---

## 3. The core bet: normalize shape, not semantics

This is the decision everything hangs off, and where "multi-provider" tools
usually die.

The three providers diverge harder than they appear. **Player identity is
per-provider** — there is no universal NFL player ID shared across ESPN, Yahoo,
and Sleeper. Scoring settings have structurally incompatible shapes. Roster-slot
eligibility rules differ. Transaction vocabularies differ. Playoff formats differ.

Building one true unified `League` model means a year of impedance mismatch and
no shipped product.

**Normalize the 80% that is structurally identical. Passthrough the rest.**

- **Normalized:** teams, rosters, standings, matchups, transactions, free agents.
  Same *shape* across every provider.
- **Explicitly NOT normalized:** scoring settings, draft logic, playoff formats,
  cross-provider player identity. Reachable via `fantasy-sports raw --view mSettings`.
- Every normalized object carries `provider`, `provider_id`, and a `raw` dict so
  nothing is ever lost.

Cross-provider player-ID mapping is deferred to a future ADR. `nflverse` publishes
crosswalks if it ever becomes necessary.

---

## 4. Layering

```
cli/         typer adapters — argument parsing only, zero logic
mcp/         fastmcp adapter — v0.3+, same registry
commands/    typed functions: THE command registry
core/        domain models (League, Team, Player, Matchup, Transaction)
cache/       SQLite, TTL per resource type
providers/
  base.py    Protocol: fetch_league, fetch_rosters, fetch_matchups, ...
  espn.py    wraps espn-api          [v0.1]
  sleeper.py wraps sleeper-api-wrapper [deferred]
  yahoo.py   wraps yfpy               [deferred]
auth/        credential specs, resolution chain, staleness detection
output/      json | table | csv renderers
reports/     scheduled artifacts — MAY call an LLM; nothing below it may
```

### Two structural rules

**Rule 1 — Commands are typed functions in a registry; CLI and MCP are both thin
projections over it.** No logic in typer callbacks. Honor this and
`fantasy-sports mcp serve` is ~100 lines of `fastmcp` later instead of a rewrite.
This buys the "ask from my phone" option without paying for it now.

**Rule 2 — `core/` and `providers/` have zero LLM dependency.** Only `reports/`
may call a model. Keeps the primitive testable and keeps token spend in one
auditable place.

---

## 5. Output contract (this is the product)

The agent-native claim lives or dies here.

- **JSON** when stdout is not a TTY; **rich table** when it is; `--output csv` flattens.
- Every payload wrapped and **versioned from day one**:

```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",
  "provider": "espn",
  "league_id": "123456",
  "season": 2026,
  "generated_at": "2026-08-26T18:04:11Z",
  "data": { }
}
```

The moment a cron job or an agent parses this, it is an API. Retrofitting a schema
version later is miserable; adding it now is free.

### Error taxonomy — the part agents actually need

Errors go to **stderr as JSON** with a nonzero exit and a stable machine code. An
agent must be able to distinguish "your cookies died" (ask the human) from "ESPN is
down" (retry later) without parsing English:

| Code | Meaning | Correct agent response |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING` | No credentials configured | Ask human to run `auth login` |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED` | ESPN cookies rejected | Ask human to re-extract cookies |
| `LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND` | Bad league ID or no access | Ask human |
| `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | ESPN 5xx / timeout | Retry with backoff |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Throttled | Retry after `retry_after` |
| `SCHEMA_DRIFT` | Response shape unrecognized | Stop; file an issue |

`SCHEMA_DRIFT` is what makes the health system (§11) actionable — it is the
trigger for both the canary's issue-filing and the client-side health check.

---

## 6. Auth

Providers diverge most here, and ESPN's failure mode is **silent**.

| Provider | Mechanism | Refresh | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESPN | `espn_s2` + `SWID` cookies, manual DevTools extraction | None | Weeks–months, silently |
| Yahoo | OAuth2 | Refresh token | Standard |
| Sleeper | None for reads (public API by username) | — | — |

Interface: `Provider.credential_specs() -> list[CredentialSpec]`.

**Resolution chain: env → macOS Keychain → config file.** Env first is
non-negotiable — cron and CI cannot reach the Keychain.

**Differentiator:** `fantasy-sports auth status` reports **cookie age and likely
staleness**, not just present/absent. Silent ESPN cookie expiry is the #1
operational failure in this space and no existing tool surfaces it.

Secrets are never logged, never printed, and redacted in all error paths
including tracebacks.

---

## 7. Multi-league configuration

A first-class requirement — John runs several leagues; a tool that assumes one is
useless by week two.

`~/.config/fantasy-sports/config.toml`:

```toml
default = "dynasty"

[leagues.dynasty]
provider  = "espn"
league_id = "123456"
season    = 2026
sport     = "football"

[leagues.redraft]
provider  = "espn"
league_id = "789012"
season    = 2026
sport     = "football"
```

`fantasy-sports --league dynasty standings`. Season is per-league and overridable
with `--season` for historical queries.

**macOS path caveat.** `platformdirs` returns
`~/Library/Application Support/fantasy-sports` on macOS, which conflicts with the
XDG-style paths specified here and in §8. We **force XDG-style paths
unconditionally** on every platform, honouring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_CACHE_HOME`
when set and falling back to `~/.config` and `~/.cache` when not. This is what
technical-audience CLIs do — ripgrep, gh, docker, and uv all behave this way on
macOS — and it is what this document already committed to. Do not rely on
`platformdirs`' macOS branch.

---

## 8. Caching

Decided now because it is a layer, and layers are hard to retrofit.

ESPN is multi-second and rate-limits. An agent exploring one question may make
eight calls. Cache sits **between provider and core** as a decorator.

SQLite at `~/.cache/fantasy-sports/`, TTL by resource type:

| Resource | TTL |
|---|---|
| Rosters, free agents | 5 min (in season) |
| Standings, matchups (current week) | 15 min |
| League settings | 1 day |
| Completed weeks, historical seasons | Forever |

`--no-cache` and `fantasy-sports cache clear` escape hatches.

---

## 9. Read/write posture

**v0.1 is read-only.** Prove the read path survives real ESPN behavior for a few
weeks before touching mutations.

**v0.2 writes** (set lineup, waiver claims, drops) ship behind:
- `--dry-run` as the **default**; mutations require explicit `--commit`
- a printed diff of before/after state
- interactive confirmation unless `--yes`
- anything autonomous routes through `/sanity-gate`

Rationale: a miscalculated automated waiver claim is a real, un-undoable cost.
This follows the standing high-stakes/irreversible-actions rule.

---

## 10. Reports — the layer that makes it worth owning

Everyone else stops at read-only data access. The interesting product is the
**scheduled artifact**:

```
fantasy-sports report start-sit --week 1 --output md
```

A Sunday-morning cron pulls the matchup, runs it through a model, and drops a
start/sit memo into the vault with the reasoning preserved. That has value at zero
stars and no external users.

Per the frugal-routing doctrine: `reports/` consults `model-route` rather than
defaulting to Claude. Data summarization and formatting are local-model work;
only genuine judgment escalates.

---

## 11. Health system — drift detection and self-diagnosis

**This is the highest-leverage part of the design.** It has a server side (the
canary) and a client side (the health check). They are one system.

ESPN's API is unofficial and breaks without notice. Every dead project in §0 died
identically: ESPN changed something -> maintainer did not notice for months ->
users hit raw stack traces -> repo looked abandoned -> people left.

### 11.1 Server side — the canary

A scheduled GitHub Action runs a live smoke suite against a real *public* ESPN
league on a weekly cadence (daily in season).

- Unit tests run against recorded `vcrpy` cassettes: fast, offline, deterministic.
- The canary is the **only** thing that touches live ESPN.
- On drift it **auto-files an issue** and **publishes `health.json`**.

That converts "silently broken" into "there is an open issue," which the existing
Foreman/shepherd fleet can pick up automatically.

### 11.2 The health manifest

The canary publishes a single static file to the repo, served free and
CDN-cached from `raw.githubusercontent.com`:

```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports-health/v1",
  "latest_version": "0.1.4",
  "min_supported_version": "0.1.2",
  "yanked_versions": ["0.1.3"],
  "providers": {
    "espn": {
      "status": "degraded",
      "checked_at": "2026-09-03T06:00:00Z",
      "known_issues": [
        {
          "code": "SCHEMA_DRIFT",
          "endpoint": "mRoster",
          "affects": "<0.1.4",
          "fixed_in": "0.1.4",
          "issue": 42,
          "url": "https://github.com/jwulff/fantasy-sports/issues/42",
          "summary": "ESPN changed mRoster player-entry shape on 2026-09-03"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "updated_at": "2026-09-03T06:00:00Z"
}
```

No hosting to run, no Pages setup, no server. The canary commits it; the CLI
reads it.

### 11.3 Client side — cheap, lazy, fail-open

**Triggers.** Never on the happy path. The check fires only when it can change
what the user does next:

| Trigger | Check? |
|---|---|
| `SCHEMA_DRIFT`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, unexpected exception | Yes, inline |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED`, `RATE_LIMITED` | No (cause is known and local) |
| Successful command | No |
| `doctor` | Yes, forced, ignores cache |

**Rules, all of them non-negotiable:**

1. **Fail open, always.** If the check errors, times out, or the user is offline,
   say nothing extra and surface the original error unchanged. The health check
   must never be able to produce an error of its own.
2. **2-second timeout.** We are already on the error path; a short wait is
   acceptable, a hang is not.
3. **Cached 6 hours** in `~/.cache/fantasy-sports/health.json`. Repeated failures
   in a loop hit the network once, not a hundred times. Well inside GitHub's
   60 req/hr unauthenticated limit.
4. **No telemetry.** It is an unauthenticated GET of a public static file. Nothing
   about the user, their leagues, or their query is transmitted. **Say this
   explicitly in the README** — "checks for updates" reads as tracking to many
   people, and here it genuinely is not.
5. **Opt out** via `FANTASY_SPORTS_NO_HEALTH_CHECK=1` or `health_check = false`
   in config.
6. Version comparison uses `packaging.version` (PEP 440), never string compare.

**Human output** — appended to stderr, after the real error:

```
Error: ESPN returned an unrecognized response shape (SCHEMA_DRIFT).

  You are on 0.1.2 — 0.1.4 is available.
  This looks like a known issue, fixed in 0.1.4:
    #42  ESPN changed mRoster player-entry shape on 2026-09-03

  Fix:  uv tool upgrade fantasy-sports
```

And when already current:

```
  You are on the latest version (0.1.4).
  ESPN status: degraded — this is a known outage, tracked in #47.
  Nothing to do but wait. Details: https://github.com/jwulff/fantasy-sports/issues/47
```

**Machine output** — folded into the error envelope so agents get it too:

```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",
  "error": {
    "code": "SCHEMA_DRIFT",
    "message": "ESPN returned an unrecognized response shape",
    "health": {
      "your_version": "0.1.2",
      "latest_version": "0.1.4",
      "upgrade_available": true,
      "upgrade_command": "uv tool upgrade fantasy-sports",
      "provider_status": "degraded",
      "known_issue": {
        "issue": 42,
        "url": "https://github.com/jwulff/fantasy-sports/issues/42",
        "fixed_in": "0.1.4",
        "summary": "ESPN changed mRoster player-entry shape on 2026-09-03"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is the agent-native payoff: Claude Code hits the error, reads
`upgrade_available: true` and `upgrade_command`, and can resolve it without
involving the human at all. When `upgrade_available` is false it knows to stop
retrying and report a known outage instead of burning turns.

### 11.4 `doctor`

One command that runs every check proactively and returns a single structured
verdict — the same shape agents already expect from tooling of this kind:

```
fantasy-sports doctor [--json]
```

Checks: installed vs latest version · ESPN provider status and known issues ·
credential presence **and cookie age/staleness** · configured leagues reachable ·
cache size and health · Python and dependency versions.

Gives both a human a single "what is wrong" answer and an agent a single call to
diagnose everything before it starts guessing.

### 11.5 The closed loop

```
ESPN changes something
  -> canary detects drift within 24h
  -> auto-files issue + updates health.json
  -> user's next command errors
  -> CLI reads health.json (cached, 2s, fail-open)
  -> human sees "known issue #42, fixed in 0.1.4, run this"
     agent sees upgrade_available:true and just fixes it
```

No human in the loop on the detection side. This is what none of the dead
projects in §0 had.

## 12. v0.1 scope

```
fantasy-sports doctor              # full health check, --json for agents
fantasy-sports auth status
fantasy-sports auth login          # guided cookie extraction
fantasy-sports league info
fantasy-sports teams
fantasy-sports standings
fantasy-sports roster    --team <id|name>
fantasy-sports matchups  --week N
fantasy-sports transactions --limit N
fantasy-sports free-agents --pos WR --limit N
fantasy-sports raw --view mSettings [--view ...]
```

ESPN only · read-only · JSON/table/CSV · multi-league config · SQLite cache ·
cassette tests · live canary in CI · health manifest + client-side check.

**Out of scope for v0.1:** writes, Yahoo, Sleeper, MCP server, cross-provider
player IDs, draft tooling, projections.

## 13. Roadmap

| Version | Contents |
|---|---|
| **v0.1** | ESPN read-only CLI, cache, config, canary + health check + `doctor` |
| **v0.2** | `reports/` — start-sit memo, weekly recap, vault output |
| **v0.3** | Writes behind `--dry-run` + confirm |
| **v0.4** | `mcp serve` adapter over the same registry |
| **v0.5+** | Second provider, only when a real need appears |

---

## 13.5 Performance and quality budgets

Measured, not asserted. Full rationale and the benchmark table in ADR-0008.

| Metric | Budget | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| `--version` / `--help` cold start | < 50 ms | `hyperfine` in CI vs committed baseline |
| Read command, cache hit | < 150 ms | `hyperfine` in CI |
| Direct runtime dependencies | ≤ 5 | dependency count check |
| Our wheel size | < 150 KB | build-artifact check |
| Line / branch coverage | ≥ 90% / ≥ 85% | hard CI fail |
| Mutation score, `core/` + `providers/` | ≥ 80% | scheduled + pre-release |

Three structural rules follow:

1. **Lazy imports are mandatory.** Naive module-scope imports of
   `typer + rich + requests + espn_api` measured 75 ms cold; `typer` alone
   measured 39 ms. A `--help` must not pay for an HTTP stack. Enforced by a test
   asserting the heavy modules are absent from `sys.modules`.
2. **`platformdirs` is dropped** — §7 forces XDG paths unconditionally anyway, so
   it buys an import and nothing else. ~30 lines of our own replaces it.
3. **Unit tests have no network at all.** `pytest-socket` blocks it, so a
   cassette miss fails loudly instead of silently calling ESPN and making the
   suite quietly dependent on ESPN being up.

## 14. Research findings that change the design

Four parallel research agents ran on 2026-08-26 before any code was written.
Their briefs are in `docs/research/`. These findings materially alter decisions
above and are binding.

### From the ESPN API brief (`03`)

1. **`AUTH_EXPIRED` cannot be a naive 401 mapping.** A bare 401 from ESPN is
   ambiguous between expired cookies and using the wrong current-vs-historical
   URL shape for the season. Classifying naively sends the user off to
   re-extract cookies that were never the problem. The adapter must double-probe
   before deciding.

2. **`SCHEMA_DRIFT` is entirely ours to build — `espn-api` offers nothing.**
   Shape problems surface as raw `KeyError`/`TypeError` from inside object
   constructors doing unguarded dict access. This is a real wrapping layer with
   context capture, not an `except X: raise Y` shim. Budget for it.

3. **`RATE_LIMITED` needs code written from scratch.** `espn-api` does not
   special-case 429 and never reads `Retry-After`; it folds into a generic
   error. The `retry_after` field promised by §5 requires intercepting before
   the library's status check.

4. **Cache below the composite calls.** `box_scores()` and `free_agents()` each
   fan out into 2–3 sequential ESPN calls with no internal dedup. Caching at the
   command layer still pays 3 round-trips per miss. Cache at the HTTP layer,
   keyed on URL+params, so calls sharing a sub-fetch actually hit.

5. **The canary must distinguish ESPN drift from our own build breaking.**
   `espn-api`'s own live CI canary was red for 12 straight days (2026-08-07→18)
   from a transitive dependency incompatibility, not an ESPN change. Pin the
   canary's dependencies as tightly as the runtime, and classify by *where* the
   exception occurred — before or after a real HTTP response came back. A canary
   that cries wolf trains everyone to ignore it.

6. **A proven canary league already exists:** `league_id=1234, year=2018`, the
   league `espn-api`'s own integration test has hit daily and unattended for
   years. Publicly accessible and structurally stable. Reuse it rather than
   standing one up.

7. **`mBoxscore` and `mPendingTransactions` are not real views.** Box scores are
   `mMatchupScore` + `mScoreboard` stitched client-side with two side-calls.
   Pending waivers come through `mTransactions2` with status filtering.

8. **Never pass `espn-api`'s `datetime` objects through.** They are built with
   `datetime.fromtimestamp()` and no `tz=` — naive and host-local. Our versioned
   envelope would silently emit wrong timestamps depending on where the CLI runs.
   Re-derive from the raw epoch-ms.

9. **`auth login` must validate and repair SWID's curly braces.** Confirmed as
   the single most-repeated manual-extraction mistake across every community
   source reviewed.

10. **There is no programmatic auth to design toward, ever.** ESPN closed the
    username/password path. v0.3 writes will still require a human-extracted
    cookie.

### From the provider data-shapes brief (`02`)

These are the ways an ESPN-only v0.1 produces an abstraction that breaks when a
second provider arrives.

11. **`Team` must carry `owner_names: list[str]`, never a single string.** ESPN's
    `owners` is a list and Yahoo's `managers` is explicitly plural with a
    co-manager flag. Both platforms support co-management natively; a `str`
    silently drops a manager.

12. **ESPN has *two* transaction surfaces** — `mTransactions2` and
    `Activity`/`kona_league_communication` — with non-overlapping vocabularies.
    Reconcile them inside the ESPN adapter so `core.Transaction` never inherits
    the asymmetry.

13. **Do not model roster-slot eligibility on the player.** ESPN's
    `eligibleSlots` makes `Player.eligible_slots` tempting; Sleeper has no
    equivalent and would have to synthesize it from hardcoded FLEX conventions
    its API never states. Model `slot` (current occupancy) only; eligibility
    lives in `raw` until a second provider proves what is shareable.

14. **`week` is not a portable integer.** Keep both `scoringPeriodId`- and
    `matchupPeriodId`-equivalents in `raw` for every provider, even where they
    are currently identical, so the shape does not change later. The split only
    bites during playoff weeks — exactly the path an in-season ESPN-only test
    never exercises.

15. **Standings are computed client-side for ESPN and Sleeper, server-side for
    Yahoo.** ESPN's API returns no sorted standings at all; `espn-api` implements
    a full tiebreaker cascade locally. Copying that into `core/` as "the"
    standings algorithm builds logic Yahoo does not need and will disagree with.
    Keep it in the ESPN adapter.

## 15. Open questions

1. **Public or private repo?** Public assumed — nothing sensitive, and the gap is real.
2. **Do reports live here or in a separate repo?** Assumed same repo, separate
   subcommand namespace, with the hard "no LLM below `reports/`" boundary.
3. **PEP 541 request for the bare `fantasy` PyPI name?** It is a fileless squat
   (v0.1, zero uploads, dead repo). Worth filing eventually; not worth blocking on.
