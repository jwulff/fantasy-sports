# Command reference

Every command `fantasy-sports --help` lists, with what it returns in every
output mode and what every failure looks like — so a reader deciding whether
to install, or an agent deciding whether to call, can see the answer without
running anything. The README covers [install](../README.md#install),
[first run](../README.md#first-run), and [using it from an
agent](../README.md#using-it-from-an-agent); this document is the part you
look things up in.

**Nothing below is typed by hand.** `scripts/render_readme_samples.py` runs
each invocation, trims the result, writes it to `docs/samples/`, and splices
it into the block between the `<!-- sample: … -->` markers in this file and
the README. `tests/unit/test_readme_samples.py` re-runs the splice and fails
if the docs and the samples disagree, so a sample cannot drift from the code
without CI saying so. Regenerate with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/render_readme_samples.py
```

## How to read a sample

Each sample is the command as you would type it, then a comment line saying
where the output came from, then the output. The comment carries four
things: the league, the source, the exit status, and the stream.

- **`ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live)`** — fetched from ESPN when
  the samples were generated. This is the public test league `espn-api`'s
  own suite has hit for years; anyone can read it, and it is the only real
  league whose output may be committed to this repository
  (`docs/testing.md` §6). **No credentials are needed to reproduce these.**
  The CLI resolves the credential chain before it sends anything, so the
  generator sets two placeholder cookies in the environment; ESPN serves a
  public league without reading them.
- **`synthetic league 99, season 2026 (replayed)`** — an invented league
  that does not exist at ESPN, served offline from
  `tests/cassettes/espn/synthetic_2026.yaml` through the same transport
  stub the unit tests use. It stands in for `box-scores` and `free-agents`,
  which ESPN refuses before 2019, and for the `auth` commands, which run
  against an in-memory Keychain so nothing real is touched. Names in it are
  invented.
- **`(synthetic)`** — an error envelope built from the exception class in
  `core/errors.py` and rendered by the output layer, for the four codes
  that need a live failure nobody can safely provoke: an expired cookie, an
  outage, a throttle, and a schema change. The shape is exact; only the
  trigger is invented.

Output marked **trimmed** has had long lists and provider passthroughs cut
down; every cut is marked with `…` and a count, and the result is still
valid JSON. Every top-level envelope key is always present. Untrimmed
samples are the CLI's bytes exactly, which is why they escape non-ASCII as
`\uXXXX`; trimmed ones are re-serialised and show `—` and `…` directly.
Paths under the generator's throwaway config directory are rewritten to
`~/.config` and `~/.cache`, which is where they would be on your machine.

The two `config.toml` files the samples ran against:

```toml
# ESPN's public test league (used for every "live" sample)
default = "public"

[leagues.public]
provider  = "espn"
league_id = "1234"
season    = 2018
```

```toml
# The invented league (used for every "replayed" sample)
default = "synthetic"

[leagues.synthetic]
provider  = "espn"
league_id = "99"
season    = 2026
```

## Global options

Every read command accepts these, before or after the command name
(`fantasy-sports --league public standings` and `fantasy-sports standings
--league public` are the same call). `auth` and `doctor` take only
`--output` and `--no-raw`, since they read no league.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--league`, `-l NAME` | Which `[leagues.NAME]` profile in `config.toml` to read. Defaults to `default`, or to the only league configured |
| `--season YEAR` | Override the profile's `season` for this call, for a historical read |
| `--output`, `-o FORMAT` | `json`, `table`, or `csv`. Defaults to `json` unless stdout is a terminal, then `table` |
| `--fresh` | Refetch from ESPN and update the cache entry |
| `--no-cache` | Neither read nor write the cache. Wins over `--fresh` if both are given |
| `--no-raw` | Strip `raw` from every normalized object, recursively, and set `raw_omitted: true`. `raw --view` ignores it |

### `--league`

<!-- sample: option-league -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings --league public --no-raw
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 0, stdout, trimmed with …:

```
<!-- /sample -->

### `--season`

The profile says 2018; the call asks for 2019, which this league never had,
so ESPN answers 404 and the CLI reports it under `LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND`:

<!-- sample: option-season -->
```bash
fantasy-sports league info --season 2019
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 5, stderr. League 1234 exists only for 2018, so this is ESPN's real 404:
```

    "agent_action": "Ask the human to confirm the league id and their access.",

      "view": "fetch_league",
      "status": 404
    },
    "health": null
  }
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `--fresh`

Compare `sources[].cached` with the `standings` sample under
[Commands](#standings), which ran a moment earlier and was served from the
cache. `--fresh` refetches every source and stores the result:

<!-- sample: option-fresh -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings --fresh --no-raw
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 0, stdout, trimmed with …:

    }

    },
    "… 9 more items"
  ],
  "error": null
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `--no-cache`

Same fetch, but nothing is stored, so the next call without the flag misses
again. A cache store is still constructed — it is what scrubs credential
values out of a response body — so `--no-cache` never changes what gets
parsed:

<!-- sample: option-no-cache -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings --no-cache --no-raw
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 0, stdout, trimmed with …:
```
```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",
  "provider": "espn",
  "league_id": "1234",
  "season": 2018,
  "generated_at": "2026-09-12T18:57:58Z",

  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "mTeam+mRoster+mMatchup+mSettings+mStandings",
      "fetched_at": "2026-09-12T18:57:58Z",
      "age_seconds": 0,
      "cached": false
    },

      "name": "players_wl",
      "fetched_at": "2026-09-12T18:57:58Z",
      "age_seconds": 0,
      "cached": false
    },
    {
      "name": "proTeamSchedules_wl",
      "fetched_at": "2026-09-12T18:57:58Z",
      "age_seconds": 0,
      "cached": false
    },
    {
      "name": "mDraftDetail",
      "fetched_at": "2026-09-12T18:57:58Z",
      "age_seconds": 0,
      "cached": false
    }
  ],
  "untrusted": {
    "[0].name": "Team 8",
    "…": "… 9 more entries"
  },
  "raw_omitted": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "provider": "espn",
      "provider_id": "8",
      "name": "Team 8",
      "owner_names": [],
      "wins": 9,
      "losses": 4,
      "ties": 0,
      "points_for": 1402.7200000000003,
      "points_against": 1191.54,
      "standing": 1
    },
    "… 9 more items"
  ],
  "error": null
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

`--output` and `--no-raw` are shown under [Output modes](#output-modes).

## Output modes

The renderer is chosen by `--output`, or, when that is absent, by whether
stdout is a terminal: a table for a person, JSON for a pipe. A failure is
always JSON on stderr whatever `--output` asked for, and stdout stays
byte-empty (see [Errors](#errors)).

### JSON is the default when stdout is a pipe

No `--output` here; the command is piped into `head`, so the format
detector saw a pipe and chose JSON:

<!-- sample: pipe -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings | head -4
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 0, stdout. No --output given; stdout is a pipe, so the renderer chose JSON:
```
```text
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",
  "provider": "espn",
  "league_id": "1234",
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `--output table`

What a terminal gets by default. The header line restates the envelope's
provenance; `raw` is left out because one ESPN team payload alone would wrap
a hundred-column table over a dozen lines; text a league member controls
(team names) renders as literal characters, never as markup:

<!-- sample: standings.table -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings --output table
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 0, stdout:
```

### `--output csv`

CSV carries `data` and nothing else: no schema version, no provenance, no
error. Nested values become compact JSON in one cell. Any string cell that
begins with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, a tab, or a carriage return is prefixed with
`'` so a spreadsheet shows it as text instead of evaluating it; a machine
consumer strips that leading quote, or uses JSON. This sample adds
`--no-raw` because a `raw` cell is several hundred characters of ESPN
internals per row:

<!-- sample: standings.csv -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings --output csv --no-raw

### `--no-raw`, before and after

Every normalized object carries the provider's own sub-object under `raw`,
so nothing ESPN sent is lost. It is also most of the bytes. Before:

`raw_omitted: false` means "nothing was suppressed here", not "`raw` is
present": the `raw --view` command has no `raw` keys in its payload by
construction and still reports `false`.

## Commands

### `--help`

The help text is generated from the command registry, so the list below is
exactly what is registered — a command becomes visible by being registered
and in no other way. This is also the cold-start path that has to stay under
50 ms, which is why it imports no HTTP stack:

<!-- sample: help -->
```bash
fantasy-sports --help
# no league (live). Exit 0, stdout:
```
```text
Usage: fantasy-sports [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Agent-native CLI for fantasy sports leagues. Every payload is a versioned
  envelope; every failure is a machine-readable code on stderr.

Options (accepted before or after the command):
  --league, -l TEXT  Named league profile from config.toml. Defaults to the configured default.
  --season INTEGER   Four-digit year, overriding the profile's season for this call.
  --output, -o TEXT  json, table, or csv. Defaults to json unless stdout is a terminal.
  --fresh            Refetch from the provider and update the cache entry.
  --no-cache         Neither read nor write the cache. Wins over --fresh if both are given.
  --no-raw           Strip `raw` from every normalized object in the payload, recursively. Marks raw_omitted=true in the envelope. `raw --view` is passthrough by definition and ignores this flag.
  -V, --version      Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help         Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  auth          3 subcommands: login, logout, status
  box-scores    List both lineups for a week's matchups, player by player, with projections.
  doctor        Run every health check: config, credentials, cache, version, provider status.
  free-agents   List unrostered players, optionally filtered to one position.
  league        1 subcommand: info
  matchups      List head-to-head pairings for a week, with both ESPN period identifiers.
  raw           Pass a view straight through to ESPN and return its payload unmodified.
  roster        List one team's roster slots: player, lineup slot, eligibility, kickoff, lock.
  standings     List teams in the provider's own rank order, with a 1-based standing.
  teams         List every team with its record, points, and owners. Unordered.
  transactions  List recent roster moves, newest first, walking scoring periods backward.
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `league info`

The league itself: name, season, sport, team count, current week, and
`roster_slots` — the slot-to-count map that makes a legal lineup
constructible from normalized output alone. `data` is one object. The
league `name` is commissioner-set free text, so `untrusted` points at it.

<!-- /sample -->

### `teams`

Every team with its record, points, and owners, in ESPN's own order (by team
id, not by rank). `owner_names` is a list because a co-managed team has more
than one; the public league's members carry no display names, so it is empty
here. Team names and owner names are member-set free text and are listed in
`untrusted`. The `standing` field is the same 1-based rank `standings`
reports.

The `teams` sample is the "before" half of [`--no-raw`](#--no-raw-before-and-after)
above.

### `standings`

The same team objects in ESPN's rank order, tiebreakers included, each with
its 1-based `standing`. Do not re-sort it: the order is the provider's
multi-rule cascade, not "wins then points".

<!-- /sample -->

### `roster`

One team's roster slots. `--team` takes an ESPN team id or a name — exact,
then a unique case-insensitive prefix, then a unique substring; anything
that matches two teams is an error naming both. Each slot carries the
`player`, the lineup `slot` it occupies, `is_starter`, and `is_locked`. The
player carries `eligible_slots`, `pro_team`, `opponent`, `projected_points`,
and the UTC `kickoff` of their game.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--team TEXT` | **Required.** Team id, or its name (case-insensitive; a unique prefix is enough) |
| `--week INTEGER` | Scoring period to read the lineup for. Omitted: the current roster |

### `matchups`

Head-to-head pairings for one week. `--week` is a **scoring period** (the
NFL week a human means). ESPN's schedule is indexed by *matchup* period, and
the two diverge when a playoff round spans two NFL weeks; the adapter
resolves that and puts both identifiers on every matchup. Pairings are
symmetric (`team_a` / `team_b`, not home/away).

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--week INTEGER` | NFL scoring period. Omitted: the league's current week |

### `box-scores`

Both lineups for every matchup in a week, player by player, with the slot
each player occupied, their own position, the pro opponent, projected and
actual points, and whether the slot `started` (counted toward the score).
Bench points are ordinary arithmetic over `started` and `actual_points`;
the CLI does not compute them. ESPN serves box scores from 2019 onward, so
the public 2018 league cannot produce one — the real refusal is under
[`NOT_AVAILABLE`](#not_available--exit-10) — and this sample is replayed
from the synthetic cassette. That fixture's per-player stat rows are for a
different scoring period than the one requested, so every player reads
`0.0` here; a live read carries real projections and totals.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--week INTEGER` | NFL scoring period. Omitted: the league's current week |

### `free-agents`

Unrostered players, most-owned first as ESPN ranks them. `--pos` is checked
against ESPN's slot vocabulary *before* the request: an unknown position is
refused as `CONFIG_INVALID`, because ESPN would otherwise answer 200 with
its default player set and the wrong answer would look exactly like the
right one. `--limit` is passed upstream as the page size and applied again
to the result. Refused before 2019, like `box-scores`; replayed here.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--pos TEXT` | Position filter: `QB`, `RB`, `WR`, `TE`, `D/ST`, `K`, … Rejected if unknown |
| `--limit INTEGER` | Maximum players to return. Default 25 |
| `--week INTEGER` | NFL scoring period. Omitted: the league's current week |

### `transactions`

Recent roster moves, newest first. ESPN's transaction view is scoped to one
scoring period with no date range, so the command walks scoring periods
backward from the current one, at most six, stopping as soon as `--limit`
is satisfied. Every period's fetch is its own entry in `sources`, and
`data_as_of` is the oldest of them. `type` is one of `add`, `drop`, `trade`,
`waiver_claim`; `players_in` and `players_out` are ESPN player ids, and the
names are in `raw.items`.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--limit INTEGER` | Most-recent moves to return. Default 25 |

### `raw`

The escape hatch: one ESPN view, passed straight through, payload
unmodified. Scoring settings, draft results, playoff formats, and anything
else the normalized model leaves alone are reachable here. Each `--view` is
fetched separately so its payload stays intact under its own key, and each
is its own `sources` entry. `--no-raw` is ignored — an unmodified payload is
the whole point — and `raw_omitted` is always `false`.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--view TEXT` | **Required.** ESPN view name; repeat for several |
| `--filter TEXT` | JSON for the `x-fantasy-filter` header ESPN scopes some views by |

Some views — `kona_player_info` is the known one — answer an unfiltered
request with a **default subset and a 200**. A partial player pool is
indistinguishable from a complete one by inspection, so the entry says so:
`complete: false` and a `warning` in words. Check `complete` before treating
a payload as the whole truth.

### `doctor`

Every health check in one report, cheapest and most fixable first. `python`,
`config`, `credentials`, and `cache` never leave the machine. `version` and
`provider_status` fetch the project's public health manifest (skipped with
`FANTASY_SPORTS_NO_HEALTH_CHECK=1`). `leagues_reachable` touches ESPN only
with `--live`. `data.status` is the worst individual check; `data.ok` is the
same thing as a boolean for a caller that only wants a gate. A bad finding is
data, not a failure: `doctor` exits 0 and never raises.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--live` | Also attempt one read against each configured league. Needs credentials |

### `auth status`

Which credentials are configured, from which link of the chain (`env`,
`keychain`, `config`), how old they are, and whether they are likely stale.
It never contacts ESPN and never prints a value. With both cookies supplied
through the environment, as a cron job would:

<!-- sample: auth-status.env -->
```bash
fantasy-sports auth status
# no league (live). Exit 0, stdout:

### `auth login`

Prompts for `espn_s2` and `SWID` without echoing them and stores both in the
Keychain. The prompt guidance goes to stderr so stdout is still only the
envelope. Nothing is written until both values validate; a SWID pasted
without its braces is repaired and reported under `repaired`. No value ever
reaches the output. This sample answered the prompts itself and stored into
an in-memory Keychain:

<!-- sample: auth-login -->
```bash
fantasy-sports auth login
# no league (replayed). Exit 0, stdout. Prompts answered with placeholder cookies, the SWID pasted without braces; the prompt guidance went to stderr:
```
```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",
  "provider": "espn",
  "league_id": null,
  "season": null,
  "generated_at": "2026-09-12T18:57:59Z",

    ],
    "keychain_service": "fantasy-sports"
  },
  "error": null
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

`auth status` immediately afterwards reports the Keychain as the source and
an age of zero days:

```json

<!-- /sample -->

### `auth logout`

Removes both cookies from the Keychain and from `config.toml`'s
`[credentials]` table, and reports the outcome per link: `removed`,
`absent`, `still-set` (an environment variable it cannot unset, named in
`env_vars`), or `unavailable` (a locked Keychain or unreadable file — the
command then **fails** with `CONFIG_INVALID`, `details.kind:
"credential_store"`, because a value may still be on the machine). Nothing
stored anywhere is a success.

<!-- sample: auth-logout -->
```bash
fantasy-sports auth logout
# no league (replayed). Exit 0, stdout:

## Errors

Every failure is one JSON document on stderr, with the same key set as a
success — `data` is `null`, `error` is not — and stdout is byte-empty, so a
parser reading stdout never sees half a payload. The process exits with the
code's own status, so a cron job or an agent can branch without parsing
anything.

| Code | Exit | Meaning | `retryable` | Agent response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MISSING` | 3 | No credentials configured | no | Ask the human to run `auth login` |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED` | 4 | ESPN rejected the cookies | no | Ask the human to re-extract them |
| `LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND` | 5 | Bad league id, no access, unknown `--league`, or unknown `--team` | no | Ask the human |
| `CONFIG_INVALID` | 6 | `config.toml` will not parse, or an argument only ESPN can validate was rejected | no | Ask the human to fix the named input |
| `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | 7 | ESPN 5xx, timeout, or an unclassifiable failure | yes | Retry with bounded backoff |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 8 | ESPN throttled the request | yes | Retry after `details.retry_after` |
| `SCHEMA_DRIFT` | 9 | A response no longer has the shape the adapter reads | no | Stop; file an issue |
| `NOT_AVAILABLE` | 10 | ESPN positively refuses this request; it will never succeed as asked | no | Do not retry; read `remediation` |

`0` is success, `1` an unclassified crash, `2` a usage error. Inside
`error`, every key is always present: `code`, `message`, `retryable`,
`agent_action` (the class-level instruction), `remediation` (this
instance's concrete next step, `null` when there is none), `details` (field
names, paths, and status codes — never a provider body, never a credential),
and `health`. `health` is `null` except on `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` and
`SCHEMA_DRIFT`, where the client health check may fold in the project's
manifest: `your_version`, `latest_version`, `upgrade_available`,
`upgrade_command`, `provider_status`, and a `known_issue` when the manifest
lists one for that code. An unclassifiable failure lands on
`PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, never on `RATE_LIMITED`: telling an agent to retry
is safe when we are wrong; telling it to back off and wait is not.

### `AUTH_MISSING` — exit 3

No cookie in the environment, the Keychain, or `config.toml`. Raised before
any request is made. `remediation` names the exact environment variables
that would satisfy it:

<!-- sample: error-auth-missing -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 3, stderr. No cookie in the environment, the Keychain, or config.toml:
```
```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",
  "provider": null,

    "details": null,
    "health": null
  }
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `AUTH_EXPIRED` — exit 4

Defined for a response that positively proves the credential is dead. No
observed ESPN response does: probed one variable at a time, ESPN's 401 body
is byte-identical for no cookies, a bad `espn_s2` with a valid `SWID`, and
either cookie alone (`docs/memory/espn-401-tells-you-nothing.md`). So today a
rejected cookie surfaces as [`LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND`](#league_not_found--exit-5)
with `details.reason: "credentials_or_membership"`, and this code is never
emitted. The shape, should ESPN ever start distinguishing:

<!-- sample: error-auth-expired -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings
# no league contacted (synthetic). Exit 4, stderr. No observed ESPN response proves a cookie is dead, so this code has never been emitted; a rejected cookie surfaces as LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND today:

### `LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND` — exit 5

Anything that is genuinely not there: a `--league` name missing from
`config.toml`, a league id ESPN does not know (or a season it does not have,
as under [`--season`](#--season) above), a private league these cookies
cannot see, or a `--team` that matches no team or more than one.

An unknown profile name — the message lists what is configured:

<!-- sample: error-league-not-found -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings --league nope
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 5, stderr:

    "remediation": null,
    "details": null,

}
```
<!-- /sample -->

No `config.toml` at all:

<!-- sample: error-no-config -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings

    "remediation": null,
    "details": null,

```
<!-- /sample -->

A `--team` nobody has — the message lists every id and name so the next call
can be right without a second command:

<!-- sample: error-league-not-found.team -->
```bash
fantasy-sports roster --team Nobody
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 5, stderr:

<!-- /sample -->

A `--team` that matches several; the CLI names them all rather than picking
one, because a roster is the input to a lineup decision:

<!-- sample: error-league-not-found.ambiguous -->
```bash
fantasy-sports roster --team Team
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 5, stderr:

}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `CONFIG_INVALID` — exit 6

Two causes, one code, because both tell an agent the identical thing — stop,
a human must change the input named in the message, retrying unchanged
cannot work. `details.kind` says which: `config` for a file that will not
parse, `argument` for a CLI argument only ESPN can validate (an unknown
`--pos`, a `--filter` that is not JSON). `auth logout` uses a third,
`credential_store`, when a link it needed could not be reached. A bad
argument the CLI *can* validate itself (`--output yaml`, a missing required
option) is a plain usage error, exit 2, with no envelope.

A `config.toml` missing a closing bracket:

<!-- sample: error-config-invalid -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings
# ESPN public league 1234, season 2018 (live). Exit 6, stderr. config.toml is missing a closing bracket:

A `--pos` ESPN does not recognise, refused before the request is sent:

A `--filter` that is not JSON:

}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` — exit 7

ESPN is down, timed out, or failed in a way the adapter cannot classify.
`retryable: true`; bounded exponential backoff is the right response.
`details.cause` is the exception type, for a human with logs to grep.

<!-- sample: error-provider-unavailable -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings
# no league contacted (synthetic). Exit 7, stderr:
```
```json

  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",

    },
    "health": null
  }
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `RATE_LIMITED` — exit 8

Only on a positive throttle signal (HTTP 429), never as a guess.
`details.retry_after` is ESPN's `Retry-After` in seconds when the header was
present, and absent when it was not.

<!-- sample: error-rate-limited -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings
# no league contacted (synthetic). Exit 8, stderr:
```
```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",

      "retry_after": 30.0
    },
    "health": null
  }
}
```
<!-- /sample -->

### `SCHEMA_DRIFT` — exit 9

A response no longer has the shape the adapter reads. `details.path` says
where, by field name, never by value. This is the signal the health system
exists to produce: the daily canary files an issue on it, and the client
check folds any matching known issue into `health`. Do not retry; file an
issue with the payload.

<!-- sample: error-schema-drift -->
```bash
fantasy-sports standings
# no league contacted (synthetic). Exit 9, stderr, trimmed with …:
```
```json
{
  "schema": "fantasy-sports/v1",

### `NOT_AVAILABLE` — exit 10

The opposite of unavailable: a *positively classifiable* refusal, made
before any request goes out, for something that will never succeed as
asked. Box scores and free agents before 2019 are the two cases today.
`remediation` names the supported alternative.

<!-- sample: error-not-available -->
```bash

### Usage errors — exit 2

Arguments the CLI can validate on its own are refused by the argument
parser, with prose on stderr and no envelope, exactly as every other
