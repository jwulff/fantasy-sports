"""The command registry.

Commands are plain typed functions. The typer CLI and the future MCP server are
both thin projections over this registry (ADR-0003), so **nothing in this
package may import typer**. A test enforces that.

Each entry is a :class:`CommandSpec`. ``handler`` is a dotted path resolved
lazily at call time, so building the registry — and therefore rendering
``--help`` — never imports a provider, an HTTP stack, or a renderer.

Three things a spec declares that make a projection possible without reading
the handler's source:

* **Its parameters** (:class:`Param`). Both surfaces are generated from these:
  ``cli/app.py`` turns them into typer options, and an MCP server would turn
  the same list into a tool schema. A handler's own signature is *not* the
  source of truth, because introspecting it would mean importing it — which is
  the 50 ms cold start ``cli/fastpath.py`` exists to avoid.
* **Whether it reads a league** (:attr:`CommandSpec.takes_league`). Every read
  command accepts ``--league``, ``--season``, ``--fresh``, and ``--no-cache``;
  the ``auth`` commands accept none of them.
* **The shape of its ``data``** (:class:`DataShape`). The envelope's ``data``
  is a list for a collection and a mapping for a single object. That was a
  convention nothing enforced until jwulff/fantasy-sports#9 wrote it down here
  and made :func:`fantasy_sports.commands.context.success` check it on every
  call, which turns it into a contract the first consumer
  (``jwulff/league-gazette``) can rely on.
