"""``fantasy-sports doctor`` — every health check, one verdict (ADR-0005 §11.4).

What a human runs when something feels wrong and what an agent runs *before*
it starts guessing: one call that answers "config parses, credentials are
present and not stale, the cache is reachable, and here is what upstream looks
like" without touching ESPN unless asked to.

**Six checks, four of them free.** ``python``, ``config``, ``credentials``, and
``cache`` never leave the machine. ``version`` and ``provider_status`` make the
one network call ARCHITECTURE §11.3 calls "forced, ignores cache" — a 2-second,
unauthenticated ``GET`` of the public health manifest
(:mod:`fantasy_sports.health.client`), skipped entirely when the user opted
out. ``leagues_reachable`` is the only check that can touch ESPN, and only
when ``--live`` is passed: an agent-native ``doctor`` that silently spent a
credentialed request every time it ran would be the opposite of what "before
guessing" means.

Every check reports its own :class:`CheckStatus`; nothing here raises on a bad
result; the doctor's own job is uniformly ``ok``. A configuration problem, a
stale cookie, an unreachable league — those are *findings*, not command
failures, exactly like ``auth status`` treats missing credentials as data
rather than an error.

Nothing here imports typer (ADR-0003). ``requests``, ``keyring``, and
``espn_api`` reach this module only through calls other layers already keep
lazy; nothing is imported at module scope beyond the standard library.
