"""Exit statuses, and the rule that an unknown failure is never a throttle.

ADR-0004's consequences say cron jobs can branch on exit codes. That is only
true if the codes are *distinct*, so every taxonomy code gets its own status
rather than everything collapsing onto ``1``. The numbers are part of the
contract: changing one is an API change, exactly like renaming a code.

The range matters. ``0`` means success, ``1`` is the conventional catch-all,
``2`` is the usage error every argument parser emits, and ``126``, ``127`` and
``128+n`` are claimed by the shell for "not executable", "not found" and "killed
by signal N". Everything here sits between ``3`` and ``9``, which is inside the
portable range and leaves room to grow without colliding with any of that.

:func:`classify` implements R12's hard rule: **an unclassifiable failure maps to
availability, never to throttling.** ``PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`` tells an agent to
retry with bounded backoff, which is safe when we are wrong. ``RATE_LIMITED``
tells it to back off and wait, which is unsafe when we are wrong — it converts
"we do not know what happened" into "stop acting", and ESPN's throttle signal is
unconfirmed enough that we would be wrong often.
