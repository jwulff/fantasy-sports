"""The normalized domain model — ADR-0002 as amended, origin R2/R3.

**Normalize shape, not semantics.** Teams, rosters, standings, matchups,
transactions, and free agents get a shared shape. Scoring settings, draft
logic, playoff formats, and cross-provider player identity explicitly do not —
they are reachable only through ``raw``. Every object here carries
``provider``, ``provider_id``, and ``raw`` so nothing an adapter saw is ever
lost.

ADR-0002's amendment matters for reading this file: normalization is selected
for **legibility per provider**, not for the cross-provider intersection. A
field may exist because ESPN exposes it usefully even where Sleeper would
leave it empty. Every such field is optional, and *absence is never drift*.

Three shapes here exist because of specific, documented traps
(``docs/research/02-provider-data-shapes.md`` §§4, 6):

* :attr:`Team.owner_names` is plural. ESPN's ``owners`` is a list from day one
  and Yahoo's ``managers`` carries an ``is_comanager`` flag; a single
  ``owner_name`` silently loses a manager in every co-managed league.
* :class:`Matchup` is symmetric (``team_a``/``team_b``), not home/away. Only
  ESPN has that distinction, and the other two would have to fake it.
* :class:`Matchup` surfaces *both* period identifiers. ESPN's
  ``matchupPeriodId`` and ``scoringPeriodId`` diverge during playoff weeks, and
  an adapter that keeps only one has already lost the information. The
  untouched provider values stay in ``raw`` as well.

Slot eligibility **is** modelled, on :class:`Player`. ARCHITECTURE §14's
finding 13 excluded it; origin R3 voids that finding, because an agent cannot
construct a legal lineup from position alone. Providers that do not publish
eligibility as player data (Sleeper computes it client-side; Yahoo reports
only ``is_flex`` for the current slot) leave the tuple empty rather than
synthesising conventions their API never states.

Nothing here imports anything beyond the standard library, and nothing here is
allowed to import ``typer``, ``click``, ``rich``, or ``espn_api``.
