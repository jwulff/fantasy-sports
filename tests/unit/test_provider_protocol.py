"""The ``Provider`` Protocol, validated on paper against three providers.

Issue #3 asks for the Protocol to be checked against Sleeper and Yahoo shapes
*without implementing them*, so v0.1's ESPN-only reality does not quietly bake
ESPN assumptions into the contract. The three stubs below are that check made
executable: each returns normalized objects built from hand-written payloads in
that provider's own shape, taken from
``docs/research/02-provider-data-shapes.md`` §§3-6.

They are deliberately not adapters. Nothing here calls a network, and nothing
here is the ESPN provider — that is U7 (#8).
