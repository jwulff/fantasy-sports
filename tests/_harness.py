"""The offline harness the command and CLI tests share.

It lives beside ``conftest.py`` rather than inside it because the cassette
scrub hooks in that file are a *security control* with its own owner
(jwulff/fantasy-sports#12), and this is ordinary test scaffolding. Both
``tests/unit/test_commands.py`` and ``tests/integration/test_cli.py`` import
from here; ``tests/`` is on ``sys.path`` for the same reason ``from conftest
import ...`` works.

**Why a stub on ``requests.get`` rather than vcrpy.** ``transactions`` walks
scoring periods backward and asks ``mTransactions2`` about periods the fixture
never recorded. A cassette can only answer "miss", but the honest upstream
answer is a **200 with no transactions in it** — a quiet week is a successful
empty result, not a failure
(``docs/memory/espn-api-is-a-shape-reader-not-a-client.md``). The stub
synthesises exactly that, refuses everything else, and counts requests, which
is the only way the upstream-call cap can be asserted at all.

``pytest-socket`` is on, so anything this stub does not answer fails loudly
rather than quietly reaching ESPN.
